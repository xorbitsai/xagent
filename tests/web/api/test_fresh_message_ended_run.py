"""A fresh message whose run ends before its handoff opens a new turn.

A fresh (not retried) MESSAGE routed on a RUNNING or WAITING_FOR_USER row
takes the live path: it claims its delivery row, tries to inject into the
live run, requests a resume and hands off to a resume that claims the lease.
The run can end FAILED (lease recovery) or COMPLETED (its own runner) at any
point in that window. The RESUME_REQUESTED transition and the resume lease
claim refuse an ended run for every message, so it is never flipped back to
RUNNING.

A refused message that was never written into the run is not settled as
unknown: its row is withdrawn and the message is accepted as a new turn,
exactly as if the snapshot had already shown the ended run -- in the same
handler when the transition refuses it, on the durable retry when the lease
claim does. A message the live run already accepted before it ended keeps the
at-most-once answer: never resumed, never resent, outcome unknown.

Every durable test runs against a real processing command row, and lease
recovery ends a run the way production does, including the orphaned-row
reconciliation it runs in the same transaction.
